# Photo Gallery Template

---

This is a starter project for creating a responsive photo gallery. Grab it
from GitHub to play around:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/hackers-of-umass/photo-gallery-template.git
```

Or, simply download the [ZIP](https://github.com/hackers-of-umass/photo-gallery-template/archive/master.zip) file.
Then try some things out:

* Changing background color
* Changing fonts
* Changing number of images per row
* Adding and removing images
* Adding captions for each image
* Making images link to a webpage when clicked

Have fun with it!
